# Real-Time Audio Fraud Detection for Scam Prevention
  
With the rapid rise of voice-based scams, fraudsters increasingly exploit phone calls to deceive
users. Particularly vulnerable groups such as elderly individuals, digitally unaware users, and first-
time internet adopters. These scams often involve impersonation, emotional manipulation, urgency
tactics, and psychological pressure, making them difficult to detect in real time.
Traditional fraud detection systems primarily focus on post-transaction analysis or text-based
signals, offering little to no protection during live phone conversations, where most financial and
emotional damage occurs.
There is a critical need for an AI-powered, real-time audio intelligence system that can detect scam
patterns as a call is happening and proactively protect users before fraud occurs.
Objective
Develop an innovative AI-driven solution that leverages real-time audio analysis and fraud detection
to:
Identify scam or fraudulent phone calls as they occur
Protect user. Especially elderly and vulnerable populations from financial and emotional harm
Provide timely alerts, guidance, or interventions during suspicious calls

# Project Overview

FraudShield AI is an AI-driven application designed to detect fraudulent phone calls in real time using live audio analysis. Unlike traditional systems that act after damage is done, FraudShield AI actively monitors ongoing calls, identifies scam patterns, and alerts users instantly.

The system is built with a strong focus on elderly and vulnerable users, featuring an Elder Mode for enhanced accessibility, simplified UI, and clear alerts. The solution combines real-time speech-to-text processing with intelligent fraud pattern detection to provide proactive protection against financial and emotional exploitation.
